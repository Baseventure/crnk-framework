Most part of the code base have been developed by https://github.com/remmeier. Ownership of those part of the code are
transferred to crnk.io. This includes:

- crnk-brave
- crnk-cdi
- crnk-client
- crnk-jpa
- crnk-validation
- crnk-meta
- crnk-security
- crnk-ui

In the following modules:

- crnk-core
- crnk-spring testing and configuration packages
- crnk-servlet testing and legacy packages
- crnk-rs testing and legacy packages
- crnk-examples

There is still some code originally developed by http://katharsis.io/ and released under the same Apache License 
v2. All the other modules are developments of crnk.io.
